And for the next few decades, it was only for the wards of the Central Government Employees only. In the 1980s it was opened for all.

It is a restructured version of the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan launched in 2009 that failed to achieve its intended targets.[2][3] Phase 1 of the Swachh Bharat mission lasted till October 2019. Phase 2 will be implemented between 2020–21 and 2024-25.[4]

Initiated by the Government of India, the mission aimed to achieve an "open-defecation free" (ODF) India by 2 October 2019, the 150th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi.[5] The objectives of the first phase of the mission also included eradication of manual scavenging, generating awareness and bringing about a behavior change regarding sanitation practices, and augmentation of capacity at the local level. The second phase of the mission aims to sustain the open defecation free status and improve the management of solid and liquid waste.[6] The mission is aimed at progressing towards target 6.2 of the Sustainable Development Goals Number 6 established by the United Nations in 2015.

The campaign's official name is in Hindi. In English, it translates to "Clean India Mission". The campaign was officially launched on 2 October 2014 at Rajghat, New Delhi by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is India's largest cleanliness drive to date with three million government employees and students from all parts of India participating in 4,043 cities, towns, and rural communities. At a rally in Champaran, the Prime minister called the campaign Satyagrah se Swachhagrah in reference to Gandhi's Champaran Satyagraha launched on 10 April 1916.[7]

The mission was split into two: rural and urban. In rural areas "SBM - Gramin" was financed and monitored through the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation; whereas "SBM - urban" was overseen by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.[8][9][10][11]

As part of the campaign, volunteers, known as Swachhagrahis, or "Ambassadors of cleanliness", promoted indoor plumbing and community approaches to sanitation (CAS) at the village level.[7] Other activities included national real-time monitoring and updates from non-governmental organizations such as The Ugly Indian, Waste Warriors, and SWaCH Pune (Solid Waste Collection and Handling).[12]

The government provided subsidy for construction of nearly 110 million toilets between 2014 and 2019,[13][5] although some Indians especially in rural areas choose to not use them.[14] The campaign was criticized for using coercive approaches to force people to use toilets.[15] Some people were stopped from defecating in open and threatened with withdrawal from government benefits.[16] The Government of India released 40,700 crore funds, under Swachh Bharat Mission, for achieving waste management in 200,000 villages.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">People have been practicing yoga for thousands of years. And today millions of people still practice dozens of styles, new and old.
It’s hard to find a recent wellness trend that has enjoyed more sustained buzz than yoga.

The number of people practicing yoga in the United States grew more than 50 percent from 2012 to 2016, according to a national survey conducted by Yoga Journal and the Yoga Alliance (the professional association that certifies yoga teachers and schools worldwide). (1) The survey found that people who practice yoga are more likely to be active in other forms of exercise like running or cycling, too, and that one in every three Americans said they were somewhat or very likely to practice yoga in the next 12 months. 

No one single reason is driving people to the millennia-old practice. Yoga experts suspect it has something to do with the combination of physical and mental health benefits associated with the practice.</p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Dance is a performing art form consisting of sequences of movement, either improvised or purposefully selected. This movement has aesthetic and often symbolic value.[nb 1] Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.[4]

An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance,[5] although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical. Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating, synchronized swimming, marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.</p>
